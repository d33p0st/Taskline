# Taskline
Rust-backed scripting bridge for creating high speed scripts.

## Description

Extension: `tskln` for raw code file and `tskbe` for encrypted binary
File-name convention: name.version.tskln / name.tskln -> when converted to tskbe it has to be name.version.tskbe (will be resolved from the file itself).
Operating System: Independent.
